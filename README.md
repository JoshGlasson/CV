Having previously worked as a commercial buyer and merchandiser, and a data analyst, I decided I wanted to follow a passion of mine and learn to code. I applied for an apprenticeship with Makers Academy in order to achieve this.

I'm currently employed by Tesco as a Software Developer Level 1, completing the apprenticeship at Makers Academy before officially starting.


## Skills

#### Communication

In all of my previous roles communication has been very important, whether that be with suppliers and training providers, or other stakeholders in the business. During my time at Makers Academy there was also a big focus on Pair Programming.

Whilst I am at Makers Academy I am maintaining a [blog](https://joshlearningto.code.blog/) about learning to code.

#### Analysis

In my roles as a merchandiser and data analyst, analysis was obviously a huge part of my job. I have always enjoyed and been good at analysis which has helped me immensely when learning how to code.

In my role as Data and Quality Executive for the Apprenticeship team in Tesco I had to learn all of the government apprenticeship funding rules. I picked these up in a short amount of time and became the go to person for questions regarding funding.


## Projects

No major projects so far, will add when I get near the end of the Makers course!
